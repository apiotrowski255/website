<p>This has been on my mind for a while and i decided it would be better if i put it down on paper instead of it staying in my head.</p>
<p>On thing i want to compare between the two is the &ldquo;Shield fall&rdquo; stunt.
The idea is that the protagonist falls from a great height and breaks their fall through the use of a shield.
I think it is important to say, the use of a shield in this manner does not break the fall. If you want to break your own fall then i would recommend taking up Judo or BJJ.</p>
<p>The two stunts below are timestamped</p>
<p>Captain America doing the stunt in winter soldier: <a href="https://youtu.be/QF38tMQ7HaE?t=152">https://youtu.be/QF38tMQ7HaE?t=152</a></p>
<p>Kratos doing the stunt in god of war (2018): <a href="https://youtu.be/ea7eWFbncU0?t=321s">https://youtu.be/ea7eWFbncU0?t=321s</a></p>
<p>I think the clear winner is god of war. And i am not saying that &ldquo;oh Kratos fall height is greater than Captain America&rsquo;s and therefore it is better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First thing - Steel beams (They are not steel beams) don&rsquo;t break like that in the way that Marvel has done it. Steel is more elastic than it is brittle. Steel is also better for Tensile rather than compression.</p>
<p>The Reaction from the stunt is also one thing to consider. Both Protagonists are &ldquo;hurt&rdquo; from the stunt. Yet i feel Kratos gives a way more genuine performance.
(He is a god after all). While Captain America acts like he is really hurt - but then walks it off?
We see the sheer will of Kratos as he looks up to the falling dragon and see&rsquo;s Baldur with his son. Once he knows that they have landed in the center (whats the name of this place?).
He runs towards his target.</p>
<p>Also what happens next after the stunt? Both Protagonists &ldquo;move&rdquo; from the area. Captain America is fleeing. While Kratos is running towards a goal.</p>
<p>The action never stops with god of war. Santa monica have somehow turned krato&rsquo;s running along with his running grunts entertaining.</p>
<p>Meanwhile - Captain America finds a bike (I don&rsquo;t know how) and flees the area.</p>
<p>God of war&rsquo;s One camera shot through out the entire game is very technically impressive and a marvel to look to.</p>
