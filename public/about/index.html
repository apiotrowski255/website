I have graduated from UNSW Sydney with a degree in computer science.
As proof, you can see my Testamur, Transcript and AHEGS.
I do Game development and Animations as a hobby. I thought about getting some &ldquo;actual&rdquo; training on these two subjects but I think I will keep it as a hobby.


I also like animations. I used to work a lot with Adobe animation/flash but ever since they started charging for that as a service, i have been more inclined to
use blender.">

<p>After reading <a href="https://manjarno.snorlax.sh/">https://manjarno.snorlax.sh/</a> i have switched from Manjaro to Endeavour OS. The main thing Manjaro had going for me was the GUI package manager. And then i came across an issue with OpenSSL, causing me to not being about to update my packages. Therefore i switched to Endeavour. In Future i think i will make the switch to Arch or Artix.</p>

<p>Interesting fact about me: Apparently, when i was really young, i used to watch &ldquo;free willy&rdquo; on repeat continuously. I could not talk at this age but i knew how to work the VHS machine.
Also according to my parents, I could not talk until at the age of four. But hey, I Einstein was a late talker too: <a href="https://profound-answers.com/did-einstein-really-not-talk-until-he-was-4/">https://profound-answers.com/did-einstein-really-not-talk-until-he-was-4/</a>
More on late talkers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_talker">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_talker</a>
My Mum tells me how worried she was when i was young and not talking. She took me to every Specialist she could see. They did a bunch of tests on me - Made sure i was not deaf.
I think they went on to find nothing. No explanation. I think there were fears that i was Autistic or had a Disability. I am glad to announce that i turned out fine. I am very happy for myself and my family.</p>
<p>I wonder if i should do a &ldquo;character stats&rdquo; page for myself? Something similar to Cyberpunk character stats? Or Elden Ring?</p>
