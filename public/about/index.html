Sure debian might be slower with the updates but it is stable as hell.

<p>Interesting fact about me: Apparently, when i was really young, i used to watch &ldquo;free willy&rdquo; on repeat continuously. I could not talk at this age but i knew how to work the VHS machine.
Also according to my parents, I could not talk until at the age of four. But hey, I Einstein was a late talker too: <a href="https://profound-answers.com/did-einstein-really-not-talk-until-he-was-4/">https://profound-answers.com/did-einstein-really-not-talk-until-he-was-4/</a>
More on late talkers: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_talker">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_talker</a>
My Mum tells me how worried she was when i was young and not talking. She took me to every Specialist she could see. They did a bunch of tests on me - Made sure i was not deaf.
I think they went on to find nothing. No explanation. I think there were fears that i was Autistic or had a Disability. I am glad to announce that i turned out fine. I am very happy for myself and my family.</p>
<p>I wonder if i should do a &ldquo;character stats&rdquo; page for myself? Something similar to Cyberpunk character stats? Or Elden Ring?</p>
