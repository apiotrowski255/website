Happy Birthday Catherine!
I often think about the times when you would take me to the gym at Carlingford. I&rsquo;m not too sure why you did it but I am glad that you did.
To be honest, If we went back to the first time you took me to the gym and past versions of us ran 21km, I think I would not finish.
Thank you for doing what you did.">

<p>Happy Birthday Catherine!</p>
<p>I often think about the times when you would take me to the gym at Carlingford. I&rsquo;m not too sure why you did it but I am glad that you did.
To be honest, If we went back to the first time you took me to the gym and past versions of us ran 21km, I think I would not finish.
Thank you for doing what you did.</p>
<p>I also think about that one time I got mad. I think I got mad because you would finish your set and then pause and wait for me to catch up.
At the time, If we have 1 minute of exercise and you did 10 burpees and I did 7 then I think we should have moved on to the next exercise
instead of me doing another 3 burpees.
I also did not like how it would take us 1-2 hours to do &ldquo;30 minutes&rdquo; of exercise. Which I did not think was correct.
Anyway, Now that I am living in Doonside I don&rsquo;t get to do much exercise.</p>
<p>Serious question, Do you want me to home school Charlie? I honestly think it will be the better alternative. Although I am not too
sure of the future. But I would certainty would like to home school him. I think we can get all the work done in 2 hours
and then have the rest of the day for whatever.
He won&rsquo;t be missing out on socialisation too, He will have way more time for swimming and boxing.</p>
<p>It also touched me that you cried a little bit at Frankie&rsquo;s for your Birthday lunch. I guess all of us coming together was heart feeling.
(Even though I was supposed to be working on the Weekend). Thank you for saying to me &ldquo;I appreciate you coming&rdquo; Even though I should be
the one thanking you. You also mention Charlie going through Puberty. I think it only just hit me how fast he is growing.
I think you should also have &ldquo;The Talk&rdquo; with him and mention to him the dangers of porn.
You have a really good opportunity to do this right.
Instead of teasing and shaming (Like how you did to me with your bluff all those years ago) focus more on the actual dangers
and brain changing effects. Chances are, he already knows of porn whether be from outside of home or even school peers.</p>

<p>There was a really good story about a warrior from a village and a mirror. The mirror would show the warrior anything in the world.
Worldest strongest warrior, worldest prettiest lady, etc.
The warrior from the village eventually surrenders to the mirror, stops training and only looks in the mirror. I can find the story
online right now and I actually think I will have to do a remake of it. But I do remember the whole story being an anecdote to
internet usage.</p>
<p>And if Charlie wants practical advice, Tell him to not jerk off onto clothing or bed sheets. It leaves stains&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, that was a slight tangent. These are the runs I want to do before the next Hoka.</p>
<h1 id="planned-runsevents">Planned Runs/Events</h1>
<p>Three Bridge run - 13th of October 2024 (Sorry this one sold out! If you like, you can have my ticket)</p>
<p>Parramatta 10K - 10th of November 2024 (We are on the wait list for this one: Confirmation No. 34754882 )</p>
<p>Sun Run 10K - 1st of February 2025 (Not open yet for registations)</p>
<p>True Grit 10K - 1st March 2025 (I have registered on your behalf. I am waiting for my access code so that I can enter too)</p>
<p>Run2Cure Neuroblastoma 10K - 6th April 2025 (Not open yet for registations)</p>
<p>Hoka Runaway - 4th May 2025 &lt;==== This will be the 21km! I have registered for us both.</p>
<p>I am not going to go for a Personal Best when doing the 21km. I&rsquo;ll aim to be by your side for the whole run. I think we are going
to have the most fun at True Grit 10K. I am tempted to get Chhay and Charlie in too.</p>
<p>Happy Birthday! Best wishes, Alex</p>
