<h2 id="pong">Pong</h2>
<p>Made in 2023. For this year i will aim to make one game a month. Starting from small simple games and progressively get larger</p>
<p>This short game was made in godot 3.5</p>
<p>Main takeaway from this project (What did i learn?)</p>
<p>I learnt the difference between reflecting a vector2d and bouncing a vector2d.</p>
<p>What could i do to improve?</p>
<p>I feel like setting the x position of the player paddle every frame is not great. There should be a better way of clamping the paddle on the y axis. However if i did not do this, the ball would apply a force to the player paddle and then it would eventually move out of the screen.</p>
<p>I think when exporting to HTML, i do not need an exit button on the main menu.</p>

<h2 id="breakout">Breakout</h2>
<p>Or as i like to call it &ldquo;Brick breakers&rdquo;. I thought this project would be easy going in since Breakout is a variation of single player pong. However one challenge i came across is that the ball&rsquo;s code needs to be abstracted. This is because there can be multiple balls in a game scene.</p>
<p>Issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is possible for the ball to be bouncing between the left and right walls infinitely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the is one remaining brick left. It is incredibly hard to hit the last bricks.</p>
</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="snake">Snake</h2>
<p>After finishing breakout, i had a choice between two games to work on. Space invaders and Snake. I decided on Snake since it seemed to me to be the harder choice.</p>
<p>The hardest part was getting the blocks to follow each other in a snake like fashion.</p>
<p>Things to do in future?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Allow the snake to tile across the screen (Leave on the left side on the screen and reenter on the right side of the screen.) This i personally find challenging.</p>
