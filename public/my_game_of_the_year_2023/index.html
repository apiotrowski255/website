<p>It would be Armored core 6.</p>
<p>There were certain moments in the game where i was in Awe. Namely.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighting the Ice Worm. Rusty&rsquo;s &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t miss&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Fighting against Rusty. With his line &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stop&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Fighting with Rusty. When he comes to help you in one of the final acts of the game.</li>
<li>Fighting against Carla. And learning about her Motto.</li>
<li>Bosses.</li>
<li>Freedom of customisation of mechs including builds.</li>
<li>I Like Ayre.</li>
</ul>
<p>I never felt hard stuck with this game the same way as Dark Souls or Sekiro. Sure I would grind and farm money for better gear, but that is really about it.</p>
<p>Armored core 6 was a lot of fun a had in a while. Fast paced action game.</p>
<p>Lets looks at the nominees for game of the year 2023. I will give my thoughts on each game (Even though I have not played it).</p>
<p>#h3 Alan wake 2</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_GVjTHtmlU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_GVjTHtmlU</a></p>
<p>The criticism here is that it is not as shallow as a pond, it is as shallow as a puddle.</p>
<p>#h3 Baldur&rsquo;s gate 3</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve played through Baldur&rsquo;s gate 3 from start to completion. I did this with a custom character doing a monk build. (level 9 Monk and level 3 Rogue).
I copied this build from YouTube (Nizargg). Dispite that - I still have a few issues with this game.</p>
<p>Save scrumming - The act of saving and reloading the game over and over again, until you get what you want.</p>
<p>Turn based combat will always be slow - And all the combat in this game is turn based. It is also chance based too.</p>
<p>#h3 Marvel&rsquo;s spiderman 2</p>
<p>First I would like to state that I liked the original model faces from the first game over the second game.</p>
<p>Another criticism of the game I have seen is that Spiderman 2 is too similar to the first game.</p>
<p>I think the reason Spiderman 2 failed so hard is because of Sweet Baby Inc.</p>
<p>#h3 resident evil 4</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83BhJAZrXrc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83BhJAZrXrc</a></p>
<p>Watching the comparsion between the old game and the newer game. I prefer the old game. It had soul.</p>
<p>#h3 super mario bros. wonder</p>
<p>Never played super mario bros. wonder. But given that it is nintendo, it is only available on the switch.</p>
<p>#h3 The legend of zelda: tears of the kingdom</p>
<p>I have touched this game a little bit (Thanks Amita!). But never got really invested into the game.</p>
<p>Since Baldur&rsquo;s gate 3 is game of the year for 2023, I will play it from start to end and then give my thoughts about it.</p>
<p>Update! - I am having a few technical issues with playing Baldur&rsquo;s gate 3. I am running the game with low graphics and frame capped at 30 fps.</p>
