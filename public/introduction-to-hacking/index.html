<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This is intended as a Christmas Gift to Jad. However i see no reason as to why it should not be public. At the end of the day, It is just my own ramblings.
However i do think i am qualified to offer some sound advice on the topic of security. After all, i have been working in IT.</p>
<p>You need to understand that this field will be a life long of learning. You will have to grow/expand your technical toolkit to understand basic things.
Sometimes it will be very frustrating. Fall in love with the process, not the end result.</p>
<p>You have to be technical.</p>
<ul>
<li>In basic terms, you need to understand how the internet works.</li>
<li>you will need to understand basic routing.</li>
<li>You will need to understand how user authentication works.</li>
<li>You will need to understand how programs and computers work.</li>
</ul>
<p>And even then, there is no guarantee you will get into Security. But you will have a good chance at getting into IT at the least. So that is a start.
Getting online Certificates increases your chances of getting into IT. CCNA is one example that will help you understand networks.</p>
<p>I remember when we had dinner in Canberra i said to you &ldquo;You should learn Linux&rdquo; to which you replied &ldquo;Yeah, everyone has told me to use Linux&rdquo;. But it seems like you don&rsquo;t
know how to start. I think for your first Linux Distro, you should use Ubuntu: <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop</a>. It is also easy to install into a machine.
Any YouTube tutorial will do.</p>
<p>You could go for Kali Linux, but that is just like any other Linux with a bunch of OpSec tools.</p>
<p>I also hope you enjoy the book i got you (Permanent Record by Edward Snowden). I know i will be purchasing another copy for myself to read through.</p>
