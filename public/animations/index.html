Software used:

Pivot
Adobe Animate
Blender (Current)

The Majority of my animations are available on my YouTube.
Major works:
Walk the walk

A animation for DART1211. This is were i met a good friend &ldquo;Suckerfish&rdquo;. As soon as she mentions Hyun dojo in class, I knew we good pals.
Apparently i did this in a week? I finished off assignment 1 and handed it in early.
I can&rsquo;t provide all the animation files for this one because it was broken up to 5 parts and then combined together in Adobe premiere pro.

Slush invaders tribute
I think with this animation i got a little impatient. I remember i just finished my two year contract with Macquarie cloud services and i was incrediblity burnt out from work.
When i left MCS, i had a goal to finish this animation off. It took longer than expected and i did not want to develop the habit of starting projects and not finishing them.
Gildedguy has seen it and he loved it: Link to his reaction.">

<p>In this animation i have also implemented a &ldquo;versioning control&rdquo; type to keep track of my progress and to retain copies/backups.</p>
<p>Engagement with this animation was a bit weird - it never went viral, but it had a steady growth. As of writing, it has over nine thousand views (It&rsquo;s pretty close to one million!).</p>

<p>A fan animation copying the formula of Animation vs Animator by Alan becker.
I was happy to have shared this with Alan becker - He replied and shared the animation on his facebook page.
I believe the video went viral because soon after Alan released his next video in the series &ldquo;Animation vs YouTube&rdquo;.
This was my first video to surpass one million views. As of writing it has surpassed two million. I doubt it will grow after that.

<p>Originally this one was going to be named &ldquo;AwesomeA vs Saminator&rdquo; or &ldquo;AA vs Saminator&rdquo;. I had a good friend Samitha Balasuriya who i went to high school with.
I thought it would be cool to work on an animation featuring myself and him battling.
I think another part of it was the music. I remember listening to the music and thinking &ldquo;Wow this is cool&rdquo;. I Imagined an epic battle with this music and i guess i brought it to life.
According to my notes - This was done in 3 months
I look back at it now with slight cringe but great fondest.
