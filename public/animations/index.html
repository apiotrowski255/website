<p>Slush invaders tribute
I think with this animation i got a little impatient. I remember i just finished my two year contract with Macquarie cloud services and i was incrediblity burnt out from work.
When i left MCS, i had a goal to finish this animation off. It took longer than expected and i did not want to develop the habit of starting projects and not finishing them.
Gildedguy has seen it and he loved it: Link to his reaction.

<p>Animation vs You (The Viewer)
A fan animation copying the formula of Animation vs Animator by Alan becker.
I was happy to have shared this with Alan becker - He replied and shared the animation on his facebook page.
I believe the video went viral because soon after Alan released his next video in the series &ldquo;Animation vs YouTube&rdquo;.

<p>Epic StickFigure Battle - Oct 26 2016
Originally this one was going to be named &ldquo;AwesomeA vs Saminator&rdquo; or &ldquo;AA vs Saminator&rdquo;. I had a good friend Samitha Balasuriya who i went to high school with.
I thought it would be cool to work on an animation featuring myself and him battling.
I think another part of it was the music. I remember listening to the music and thinking &ldquo;Wow this is cool&rdquo;. I Imagined an epic battle with this music and i guess i brought it to life.
According to my notes - This was done in 3 months
I look back at it now with slight cringe but great fondest.
