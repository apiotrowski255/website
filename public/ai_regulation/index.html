Control who gets to create AIs
Ensure that AIs do not spread misinformation
Ensure that AIs and the companies that create AIs follow all rules in regulation.

I disagree with this. If anything, it should be enforced that AIs have to be free and open source.">

<p>I thought i would put down some of my thoughts upon hearing news about AI regulation.</p>
<p>This is what i heard on the news:</p>
<ol>
<li>Control who gets to create AIs</li>
<li>Ensure that AIs do not spread misinformation</li>
<li>Ensure that AIs and the companies that create AIs follow all rules in regulation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I disagree with this. If anything, it should be enforced that AIs have to be free and open source.</p>
<p>If regulation was to go through - what would happen is that a few companies will have total control of the AI market. It would be impossible for one single person to compete in the AI market.</p>
<p>It will solidify power with those companies that own the AI.</p>
<p>Instead let AI be the wild wild west.</p>
