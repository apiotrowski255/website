<p>It would be Armored core 6.</p>
<p>There were certain moments in the game where i was in Awe. Namely.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fighting the Ice Worm. Rusty&rsquo;s &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t miss&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Fighting against Rusty. With his line &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stop&rdquo;.</li>
<li>Fighting with Rusty. When he comes to help you in one of the final acts of the game.</li>
<li>Fighting against Carla. And learning about her Motto.</li>
<li>Bosses.</li>
<li>Freedom of customisation of mechs.</li>
</ul>
<p>I never felt hard stuck with this game the same way as Dark Souls or Sekiro. Sure I would grind and farm money for better gear, but that is really about it.</p>
<p>Armored core 6 was a lot of fun a had in a while. Fast paced action game.</p>
