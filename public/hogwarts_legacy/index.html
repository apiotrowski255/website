<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this game for a while.
This is the type of game that Rebecca would have loved, if she was a gamer.</p>
<p>But i am skeptical, and i would like to call it. I don&rsquo;t think this game will be a good game at release.</p>
<p>This studio does not have a track record of producing good games.</p>
<p>The combat does not look good to me - It is all ranged combat,
It does not look like there is any strategy to the combat.
It does not show any meaningful spacing, guard or timing.</p>
<p>I have heard people saying this will be on par with Witcher 3 - I disagree with this.</p>
<p>Will this be game of the year for 2023? I highly doubt it.</p>
<p>I feel a lot of people are expecting this to be an amazing game. It is banking on the Harry Potter nostalgia.</p>
