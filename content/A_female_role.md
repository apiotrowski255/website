This has been on my head for a while and i just wanted to write it down. 

I think the same can be said for male characters. 

## A female's role

Examples of bad female characters
- Sasquatch from Cyberpunk 2077
- Abby from Last of us 2
- MJ from Spiderman 2

Example of good female characters
- Firekeeper from Dark souls 3
- Melina from Elden Ring
- Emma from Sekiro

"Oh you are only picking females in support roles!" - No. Look at Melenia from Elden Ring. Considered to be the hardest boss in the game.  Melenia is also blind and is technically an amputee. 

There might be an argument of making the hardest boss female in a game but I believe Melenia from Elden Ring is a good example. She is considered the hardest boss in Elden Ring. But she still plays into feminine traits. 

And this does not only apply to games:
- Sarah from Terminator 1 & 2
- Mulan from Mulan
- 

You can even see when Eddie (World's strongest man) deadlifted 500KGs, Right afterwards he thanked his wife. 
His Eye colour literally changed with that Lift.
