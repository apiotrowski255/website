I've been thinking about this game for a while.
This is the type of game that Rebecca would have loved, if she was a gamer. 

But i am skeptical, and i would like to call it. I don't think this game will be a good game at release. 

This studio does not have a track record of producing good games.

The combat does not look good to me - It is all ranged combat,
It does not look like there is any strategy to the combat. 
It does not show any meaningful spacing, guard or timing. 

I have heard people saying this will be on par with Witcher 3 - I disagree with this. 

Will this be game of the year for 2023? I highly doubt it.

I feel a lot of people are expecting this to be an amazing game. It is banking on the Harry Potter nostalgia.
