I thought i would put down some of my thoughts upon hearing news about AI regulation.

This is what i heard on the news:
1. Control who gets to create AIs
2. Ensure that AIs do not spread misinformation
3. Ensure that AIs and the companies that create AIs follow all rules in regulation.

I disagree with this. If anything, it should be enforced that AIs have to be free and open source.

If regulation was to go through - what would happen is that a few companies will have total control of the AI market. It would be impossible for one single person to compete in the AI market.

It will solidify power with those companies that own the AI.

Instead let AI be the wild wild west.
