I wanted to put down into writing all the times i have failed romantically. 

Honestly all this shit is turning me misgontic. I remember my sister Caroline being "Rage Sad". While we were in the car she was driving. She told me to never date. 

A girl can have various reasons to not date. What i've heard
- "Parents say No"
- "I don't see you that way"
- "I know you too well"

No Matter the reason, It all comes down to one root - "You are not wanted". 

Primary School 
- Beverley Lau
- Stephanie Roylance


High School
- Michelle "core" - "neven" (I forget how to spell her last name) 
Facebook is showing as Michelle Maria. She is married now to another dude. 
But during High school - I was friends with her. 
She dated a guy name patrick, and then dated another guy called Ariel. Seriously fuck this guy. 
- Amita
This one was just unlucky. So many bad things happened. Sister was on my facebook. 
- Luna zhou
I asked her out over facebook but she rejected me. She did went into a relationship with another guy named brandon. According to her it was a bad relationship. 
I guess she did give me a chance - We watched star wars movie together. 
- Priyanka Chimera 
I really liked her! But she did not like me back. 
- Upasna 
I am not too sure about this relationship. William said it was obvious that she was into me. She is now miss india.
- Jenny 
- Farida
She is a model now...

University
- Zhin (chinese exchange)
- That one girl from Muay thai class - I forgot her name. 
There were a few girls from Uni - but none would be interested. 

Work
- Jenny (I knew her from high School) 
- Jessica Xu (family friend) - said "she knows me too well".
- Ashley - Stated she has a boyfriend
- Caitlin - Stated she has a boyfriend. 


I guess there was one girl Brenana from Primary School. That kinda sucked though. I remember she was full starting at me. That made me uneasy. She then broke up with me over sms messager.
