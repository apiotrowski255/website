To be honest. I don't think this will be a good film. There is just something off about it. I have not seen the whole film only bits and pieces from YouTube including the trailer. 

It sucks because since Puss in Boots 2, I had high hopes for future Dreamwork animations. 

Kung fu panda 4 has not been released in Australia. But just judging from the trailer something seems off. Where are the furious five? Why don't i like this new fox character? Po's progression from Dragon Warrior to Spirital leader? That does not make sense to me.

From best to worst
- Kung fu panda 2
- Kung fu panda
- Kung fu panda 3
- Kung fu panda 4

I think Kung fu panda 4 will be the weakest of the series. In my opinion, it's been a bit downhill from 3. And 3 did have "good moments". But i feel as a whole it is not a good film.


## Kung fu panda 2
I think this is the best film of the series. 
I never believed singular special weapons - Stuff like the green sword from hidden dragon, couching tiger.
Instead the cannon is reproduceable - So Shen has many Cannons. 
The main hench man wolf is loyal to his pack - And his loyalty is misplaced in the villian. Only to be killed by Shen, Because he would not shoot his own wolves. 

## Kung fu panda 
Was great for it's time! Solid Story, Solid characters. And it was fun and entertaining to watch.

## Kung fu panda 3
This is were it starts to go downhill for me. And it does not make sense to me. They had Han's Zimmer do the score for Kai.
yet Kai is a weak character for me.
- His Theme is fantastic
- His strength is impressive, He beats a lot of kung fu masters and turns them into Jade Warriors. 

## Kung fu panda 4
Have not seen it. But From the trailer it does not seem good. There is no mention of the furious five.
