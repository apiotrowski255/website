Hello!

This is intended as a Christmas Gift to Jad. However i see no reason as to why it should not be public - It is just my own ramblings.

So you want to get started with Cyber Security and the likes? Well you have reached the right place! I think i am qualified to say a word or two on the topic. 

Be warned! The more you read into this and the more you study. The more your views on the world will change. You will start to be less Corporation/Government agencies and more 
on the side of individuals and the public people. 

First off - You have to understand that this field will be a life long of learning. You will have to grow/expand your technical toolkit to understand basic things. 
Sometimes it will be very frustating.

You have to be technical. 

- In basic terms, you need to understand how the internet works.
- You will need to understand how user authenication works.
- You will need to understand basic routing
- You will need to understand how programs and computers work. 

And even then, there is no guarantee you will get into Security. But you will have a good chance at getting into IT at the least. So that is a start.

Some Advice - Fall in love with the process, not the end result.

Otherwise known as Capture the Flag. 



I remember when we had dinner in Canberra i said to you "You should learn linux" to which you replied "Yeah, everyone has told me to use linux". If you are not using linux right now
then i take great offense to this. If everyone is telling you to do one thing. It's probably a good thing to do. 

You might be wondering - WHy did i get you Permentant record by Edward Snowden? While medibank and Optus were big data leaks, nothing can top what Edward has leaked out to the public
out of essentity.
