There are some certain games that i will never play - Or at least try to avoid.

Starcraft 2
CS:GO now known as CS2
Actually My colleagues are getting me into CS2 - It is a fun game to play after work. But I do notice my own rage. 

League of legends - I have never played this game and I wear that as a badge of honour.
Dota2
Overwatch 

Maybe TF2?
- Too many bots
- Too much time
- Too much bullying. 

FIFA
