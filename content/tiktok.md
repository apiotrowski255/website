I know this is old news but i thought i would write down some of my thoughts about this. 
I've heard that Tiktok has been banned or at least has been restricted in some ways.

I find this stupid. Personally i don't use tiktok, and probably never will. (Unless i want to get internet famous).

What makes tiktok different? Why isn't the same standard held for other apps like reddit, facebook, google, etc.

This is because tiktok is chinese owned. and this is bias and unfair
