I am really looking forward to the Elden Ring DLC. You can see the trailer here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLZenOn7WUo

I think this DLC will breath life into this game again. You can see in this the steam charts - player count was around 45K on the 21st of February and it jumped up to 108K on the 26th of February. 

I am very interested in the Lion dancer boss - It is technically two people with a lion's mask. It definitely draws from Chinese Lion dancers 
- Side note - I really like Chinese Lion Dancers, Chinese Wushu performers and Chinese Mask changers. 
- The Story with Chinese Mask changers: There was a warrior who was able to change his face in the middle of battle. Can you imagine clashing swords with the enemy and then suddenly you see your mother's face? Sorry weird tangent. 

There will be new weapons, new weapon types, new equipment, new spells, new incantations, new enemies, new Bosses and a new area to explore. 

Messmer looks to be a new remembrance boss.

Anyway i look forward to this DLC. I have prepaid for this content.
