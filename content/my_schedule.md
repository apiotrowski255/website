I do my best to follow this schedule. Although i usually miss 6am morning classes. 6am at Winter is hard due to the cold. I have my Monday and Wednesday mornings free, so i thought about going to Club de lutas to do 6am classes with them. However this will require me to use a car and be back in time for my mother to use. I am leaning towards not doing this since i would also like to save on fuel. 

Other than this, i work my usual job that is 9am to 5pm. Sometimes i am oncall for work. And when i am oncall, ideally i should not leave the house in case i get called for work outside business hours.
