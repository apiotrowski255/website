This has been on my mind for a while now. I just want to write it down. Here is the Problem. This problem came from COMP3121.

Given a 2D grid that is of 2^N by 2^N size, and given that one of these tiles is filled in any tile (positon k, l). 

Now if we only have these L shapes tiles. 
* * * 
* * X
* X X 

Can we fill this grid completely? 

The Solution to this is to divide and conquer.
