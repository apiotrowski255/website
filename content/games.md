Games i have made

Spongeswap

I am really proud of this one because this is a game that i created without following a tutorial or youtube series. I did this on my own and using free online resources to do so. 
- Used OpenGL and OpenAL
- This game was also finished when i left Macquarie cloud services
- This game was the birth of the following two tutorials: ThinMatrix and Cross Coast Gaming
- Github link: https://github.com/apiotrowski255/SpongeSwap
- Youtube gameplay:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOVHGc2zwcM
