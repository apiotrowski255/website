Ubisoft announaced Assassin's creed Shadows - They will base this in fedual Japan.

Fans of the Assassin's creed series have been asking for an Asian Assassin's creed for 10 years+

I don't think this will be a good game...
The series have been downhill since syncidate.

Instead options are:
- Sekiro
- Ghost of Tsumai
