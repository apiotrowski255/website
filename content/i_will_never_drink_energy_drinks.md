I will never purchase a prime energy drink. I will never drink any energy drinks (redbull, monster, etc). This is not to say I haven't drank energy drink in the past. I certainly have. 

I'm not against drinking soda drinks. But even then, i will limit my consumption of soda. 

I will also not drink coffee. 
I am 50/50 on tea - I heard tea stains your teeth pretty bad. 

My Alternatives are:
- Juice
- Not all juice are made equal, Some companies put a lot of sugar into their juice. The two i go for are
- Nudie https://www.nudie.com.au/
- V8 https://www.v8juice.com.au/ (not to be confused with the V energy drink)
- Water
- cabanated Water

I think i would drink 'certain' types of sports drinks such as powerade or gatorade. These are high in sugar, but the drink's main goal is to hydrate you. 

I think i will also mention that i will never drink Prime.

Basically you need sugar to hydrate fast.

I have had the issue where i would only bring water to training. And then i would drink too much water when feeling thirsty. Because I drank too much water this would cause me to vomit.
