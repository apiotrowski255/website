I love it so much that it is my game of the year 2024. 

The game starts off so strong, with on of the most badass openings. 

My critisms of this game
- First off, It is on steam. Steam will take 30% of their sale. This might be 20% for larger games.
- Second, The game was made in unreal engine. Unreal will take a percentage of their sales.

So despite game science putting a tonne of effort into this game, I worry if they are seeing a return of investment.
I really hope they do, as this is a fantastic game and we need to see more of these types of games. 

Personally, I prefer this game over elden ring. 
- Grab attacks from bosses don't instantly kill you. 
- No punishment for deaths. 
- There is no death status (fuck death blight in Elden Ring and fright in Sekiro both of which cause instant death).

One critism that I am hearing from the internet is that there is only one weapon type - the staff. But in my opinion, 
this is all you need. 
By having one weapon, they can make the combat gameplay so much cleaner, smoother and tighter. 


I wish game science the best of luck and hope they continue making games like this. 

This game makes me proud to be chinese. (Well at least part chinese)

I have spoiled the game for myself a little bit - But will attempt to continue to play the game blind. I just wanted to know 
how to get to the secret boss in chapter 2, so i looked at a guide. I really want the good ending on my first playthrough

Another critism of mine - While the environments are beautiful and something i really apprise. It is not always clear where
you can go as a player. 

Again, another critism, enemy scaling on ng+ and beyond. I am not too sure personally on the scaling yet, But from what i have seen
online, it seems very in favour of the enemies. Enemies can one shot the player on full health. I hate one shots. 

I love this game so much that it actually makes me want to learn Chinese. There are people out there who play with English Dub, 
But I do think the Chinese version has better voice acting (Even when I have no clue what they are saying lol.)
Therefore I play this game Chinese dub with English subtitles.
