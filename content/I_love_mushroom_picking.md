I love mushroom picking.

This is usually an Activity that I do with my dad. I am not sure if my mother would be a fan of this activity.

Basically what we do, Is that we wake up at 3-4am in the morning, and we travel to the blue mountains, Past lithgow.

The places i remember Are Lithgow, Black Springs and Norway (not the country).

But i don't know exactly where we were for mushroom picking we were - Only small Peter knows.
