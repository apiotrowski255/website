Oh boy are we in for a story. I hope you find this as funny. I remember when i was walking home with samitha, He was laughing squatting holding his belly. 

So there was this girl georgia white. I don't know how, 
My Sister Caroline was definitely involved. 
It was supposed to be a double date - Me, Georgia, Matthew and her friend.
I travelled to castle hill mall with my friend Matthew, BUT she arrived alone. She stated her friend could not come. 
We were supposed to watch a movie - Ice age 4 - Only thing is that me and matthew already got our tickets, so they seated us right next to each other. 
They placed Georgia right behind us... 

Occiasionlly i would turn 180 degrees and say "You doing okay back there?"
What i saw was, her looking at her phone, total darkness, only to be lit up by her phone light. 
It was clear that she did not care about the film. 

Afterwards she left us and went home. I don't think we talked again after that...
