Hi my name is Alex and i currently work at [vault cloud](https://vaultcloud.com.au/) as a cloud Admin (Customer support)

I have graduated from UNSW Sydney with a degree in computer science. 
As proof, you can see my [Testamur](/unsw_degree/testamur.pdf), [Transcript](/unsw_degree/transcript.pdf) and [AHEGS](/unsw_degree/AHEGS.pdf).

I am considering continuing my studies at AIE and specialise in Game Programming.
For the longest time, i could always envision myself working as a game programmer.
Right now i do this as a hobby - Self enrolled courses.

I am currently running on Manjaro Distro but i am considering switching to debian: https://manjarno.snorlax.sh/
Sure debian might be slower with the updates but it is stable as hell.
The other two options for me would be Arch or Artix (Basically Arch without systemd).

Interesting fact about me: Apparently, when i was really young, i used to watch "free willy" on repeat continuously. I could not talk at this age but i knew how to work the VHS machine.
Also according to my parents, I could not talk until at the age of four. But hey, I Einstein was a late talker too: https://profound-answers.com/did-einstein-really-not-talk-until-he-was-4/
More on late talkers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_talker
My Mum tells me how worried she was when i was young and not talking. She took me to every Specialist she could see. They did a bunch of tests on me - Made sure i was not deaf. 
I think they went on to find nothing. No explanation. I think there were fears that i was Autistic or had a Disability. I am glad to announce that i turned out fine. I am very happy for myself and my family. 


I wonder if i should do a "character stats" page for myself? 
- Body (Strength)



- Reflexes



- Technical Ability (Which in today's world is the same as Intelligence?)
