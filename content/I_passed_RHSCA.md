"Feels like a dream" - Elden ring

For a long time RHSCA has been one of my goals. Actually since I heard about it when I started working at Macquarie.
I was labelled "The linux guy", Even though my linux skills were pretty average. (There were certainly better people in my team than me).
Even the senior engineer on evening shift would tease me on linux.

I think the reason why I got the job was because i faked it til i made it. Well not really. The reason why I got the Job was because
I was wanted and they needed someone. Evening shift only had 3 engineers (including myself). So it was very bare bones. 
I guess i was stupid enough to go "3pm to 12am shift, Sign me up!" This was my first IT job, So I don't think I had much to choose from.
I still have mixed feelings about this Job. On one hand, I am glad that I fullfilled my contact and lasted 2 years at Macquarie cloud services.
On the Other hand, Staying up to 2am continously really screwed up my sleep. I did not have much of a life outside work.
My degree was delayed by this Job. 

So what is next? I feel the next step would be to get RHCE. 
As of right now (27th Jul 2024). I work a lot with OpenStack. So I should also consider CL110. 
I am also considering compTIA because i hear it is easy.
