An alternative title i had for this page "I AM WOLVERINE!!!"

- Seriously, I heal from injuries very quickly
- BJJ Brusies disappear within the week.

I competed in a BJJ tournament with an extremely sore back - It felt like i almost broke my back. How can anyone do this?
I don't want to forget the night of extreme back pain and the hardship i faced when going to the toilet.



I will miss being young when i am old...
